## Project Overview

The goal of this annual project is to develop a social network where users can propose small programs designed to transform input files into output files. These transformations can include filters, translators, and more. Each user will have their own collection of programs, which they can either import or edit online. Users can combine their programs into pipelines, which will be graphically editable, allowing for intermediate file visualization.

Key features of the project include ensuring compatibility between programs (e.g., if the first program outputs an image, the next must accept an image as input), describing the expected inputs and outputs of each program, and incorporating a robust social component.

## Social Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **Friend/Followers Relationships**: Users can connect with each other.
- **Group Management**: Create and manage user groups.
- **Content Sharing**: Share code and data among users.
- **Likes**: Allow users to like content.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on parts of the code (optional).
- **Version Control**: Manage different versions of programs.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit programs simultaneously (optional).

## Code Execution

- **Secure/Isolated**: Ensure the execution environment is secure and isolated.
- **Scalable**: The platform should handle scaling efficiently.
- **Multi-language Support**: Support at least two programming languages.
